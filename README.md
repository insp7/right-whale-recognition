# Right Whale Recognition -- Kaggle Challenge
A computer vision task to identify individual Right whales from images, aiding in population tracking and monitoring. The challenge aimed to automate the manual, time-consuming process of whale identification used by marine biologists.

From Wikipedia:
Right whales comprise three species of substantial baleen whales within the genus Eubalaena:
the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis), the North Pacific right whale (E. japonica), and the Southern right whale (E. australis).
