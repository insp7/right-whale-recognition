Unlike many commonly cited classification tasks which is to 
classify images into different species (bird, tree leaves, dogs in ImageNet), 
this task is to classify images of the same species into different individuals. 
So the classifier must pick up the fine details of the 
callosity patterns regardless of image perspective and exposure etc.

Since the task was a bit confusing at first, let me reiterate it and clarify what it is: 
We're trying to identify which whale appears in each image, categorized by whaleID in our dataframe. 
We are not identifying whales by species, but instead whether it's Kayla, Takara, etc.
